# CIS-350 Project 1

## About
Trash Pick - Up Simulator Made by John Green, Zach Wilson, Lucas Johnson, Colin Gamagami, Devun Schneider

Walk around a small environment and pick up trash - the trash, however, respawns at a steadily increasing rate. The only way to beat the trash torrent is to recycle/throw away what you collect in return for resources, and use those resources to make tools that will aid you to pick up the trash faster. To win, outlast the timer. If the trash consumes you and the environment - Game Over.
