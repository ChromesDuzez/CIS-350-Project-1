# CIS-350 Project 1

## About
Trash Pick - Up Simulator Made by John Green, Zach Wilson, Lucas Johnson, Colin Gamagami, Devun Schneider

Walk around a small environment and pick up trash - the trash, however, respawns at a steadily increasing rate. The only way to beat the trash torrent is to recycle/throw away what you collect in return for resources, and use those resources to make tools that will aid you to pick up the trash faster. To win, outlast the timer. If the trash consumes you and the environment - Game Over. 

## Installing from the GitHub Release
Choose the Release of your choosing then download the standalone build zip file for that release. They generally follow the naming scheme of "Trash_Pick-Up_Simulator-[State]-V#-#.zip". Then unzip the game folder from the zip file, and place the contents of the game in a directory of your choosing.
You can send a shortcut for the Trash_Pick-Up_Simulator.exe to the desktop should you wish.
All you need to do is click on the exe to launch and bob's your uncle.

## Playing the Dev Branch
To play the Dev Branch, all you need to do is follow the instructions below to clone the Repository...
- Install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (which I recommend for new users). 
- Either sign in with an existing github account or skip the sign-in step by supplying a username and email.
- Hit "Clone a repository from the Internet..." then Click the URL button
- Paste `https://github.com/PlatFormPlayZ/CIS-350-Project-1` into the URL Bar
- Then choose the file location that you would like to have the repo cloned to (Have a specific folder for it.)

Then Once you have the Repository cloned, you need to open it in Unity...
- Install [Unity HUB](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe) on your computer.
- For unity, you do have to have an account, so make sure you make on and or sign in yours. If you are making one, be sure to verify your email.
- Once you are signed in, skip the installation of the latest version of unity (you don't need it for this tutorial but you can get it if you want it).
- Click agree and get Personal Liscense.
- Now we need to install [Unity 2020.1.4 (aka 2020.1.4f1)](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.1.4) then click `Install this version with Unity Hub`.
- Then select the following Modules before continueing, 
  - Android Build Support
  - WebGL Build Support
  - Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)
- Continue and Install 2020.1.4f1 (this is going to take some time before you can move onto the last step)
- If an installation page pops up for Visual Studio, add the module `Game Development with Unity` before clicking `Install`.

Now that we have the repo cloned, unity installed, all that is left is to open the project in unity...
- Under the Projects tab in Unity Hub click `open`
- Navigate to the folder which we cloned our repo to. By Default it is `%UserProfile%/Documents/GitHub/CIS-350-Project-1`
- Select Trash_Pick-Up_Simulator folder in the repo then click `open`
- Once the project has opened, you can play in the development environment. Do so by going to scenes > MainMenu then Play at the top.

If you have an error wher Unity is failing to load the project due to the layout see [this article](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1712501/stuck-in-failed-to-load-window-layout-loop.html).
To summarize try:
- Go to `%UserProfile%/AppData/Roaming/Unity/Editor-5.x/Preferences/Layouts` and delete `LastLayout.dwlt`
- Then go to the cloned Repo folder then  `./Trash_Pick-Up_Simulator/Library/` and delete `CurrentLayout-default.dwlt`
